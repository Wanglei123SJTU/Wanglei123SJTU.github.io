I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Department of Industrial Engineering & Management at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am majoring in Industrial Engineering and minoring in Finance.

Currently, I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zikun Ye](https://zikunye.com/) on Source Attribution in Generative LLMs. Simultaneously, I also have the greatest honor to be supervised by [Prof. Natalie Mizik](https://foster.uw.edu/faculty-research/directory/natalie-mizik/) on Gaining Hydrogen Perceptions based on social media analysis. 

**My research interests mainly focus on quantitative marketing, especially the application of Large Language Models.**
