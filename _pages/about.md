Hello! I'm a third year undergraduate student from Department of Industrial Engineering & Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ye](https://zikunye.com/) from Marketing at the Michael G. Foster School of Business, University of Washington in Seattle. Since May 2024, I have been working under Prof. Ye's guidance on several research projects. 

Currently, we are conducting a study on sentiment analysis of information from U.S. social networking sites. **My research interest mainly focus on machine learning in the contexts of digital platforms and marketplaces.**
