I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Department of Industrial Engineering & Management at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am majoring in Industrial Engineering and minoring in Finance.

Currently, I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zikun Ye](https://zikunye.com/) and [Prof. Hema Yoganarasimhan](https://faculty.washington.edu/hemay/) on Source Attribution in Generative LLMs. Simultaneously, I also have the greatest honor of being supervised by [Prof. Natalie Mizik](https://foster.uw.edu/faculty-research/directory/natalie-mizik/) on Promoting Equitable Hydrogen Energy Access for Disadvantaged Communities.

My research interests mainly focus on Quantitative Marketing, especially the application of Large Language Models.
