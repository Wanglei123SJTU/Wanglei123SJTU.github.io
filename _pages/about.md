I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Quantitative Marketing at the [Foster School of Business, University of Washington](https://foster.uw.edu/). I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zikun Ye](https://zikunye.com/) and [Prof. Natalie Mizik](https://foster.uw.edu/faculty-research/directory/natalie-mizik/).

My research interests lie in quantitative marketing, with a current emphasis on large language models, machine learning, and their applications in understanding consumer behavior and market design.

Previously, I received my B.Eng. in Industrial Engineering (minor in Finance) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).
